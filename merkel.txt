## FAQs

### Account

<details>

<summary>How does account sign-in work?</summary>

Merkle Trade is a decentralized protocol on Aptos blockchain. This means that trading on Merkle Trade is you are interacting with the protocol on the blockchain while retaining full custody of your account and balance.

_How Google sign-in works_

When you sign in with Google, your unique blockchain account is derived from your Google account credentials. Each time you trade on Merkle Trade, you sign transactions with your blockchain credentials stored in your browser. These credentials do not leave your browser and you retain full custody.

This account setup is enabled by Zero-knowledge proofs. For more information, refer to the [Aptos Keyless documentation](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/aptos-keyless/how-keyless-works).

_Is there a way to recover my account even if something happens to the website?_

Yes. Aptos Keyless supports a recovery path where a recovery service can be activated then users can recover their accounts (See [AIP-61](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-61.md#recovery-service)). We also plan to add a feature that will let you add a backup key to your account.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I add Google sign-in to an account created with a wallet?</summary>

<img src="https://2469880511-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fmwt0Dje2oDasvK6hXXbX%2Fuploads%2FC7oXa8SbgvnXBPJ6grEp%2FWalletless-Link-Google.gif?alt=media&#x26;token=2e3140d7-6167-40bb-ac41-cc707b421d31" alt="" data-size="original">

If you have an account created with a web3 wallet, you can add Google sign-in to it. Once linked, you'll be able to sign in with either Google or your web3 wallet.

We recommend **linking Google to your Aptos wallet account ONLY IF your Aptos account is used solely for Merkle Trade**. Adding Google Sign-In introduces a new authentication method, affecting the overall security of your account beyond Merkle Trade. After linking, the security of your Aptos account will be tied to the security of your Google account. Only proceed if you fully understand these security implications.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can sign in with EVM wallet?</summary>

We have temporarily paused support for EVM wallets for sign-in while we work on a better solution for onboarding EVM wallet users.

Users who previously signed in with an EVM wallet can still do so. However, we recommend linking a Google account for easier access, as we plan to phase out EVM wallet support in the long run.

</details>

### Deposit/Withdrawal

<details>

<summary>How do deposits/withdrawals work?</summary>

Deposit on Merkle Trade is a fully decentralized process. Here's how it works:

* A unique EVM deposit address is derived from your Aptos account address.
* Once funds are sent to the derived deposit address, a DirectDeposit contract is deployed at that address by DirectDepositFactory.
* Keeper triggers either `sendToAptos` or `swapAndSendToAptos` to swap and transfer the asset through the [CCTP bridge](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-getting-started).

The DirectDeposit smart contract has been fully [audited by OtterSec](https://osec.io) for security and its code is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/merkle-trade/merkle-evm).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why haven‚Äôt I received my deposit/withdrawal?</summary>

Deposit processing time by blockchain (average):

* Aptos, Avalanche: 1 minute
* Polygon: 8 minutes

# Position Management

## Add Collateral

When you add collateral to an active position, the amount you provide with the _add collateral_ order will be added to your current position. This feature can be helpful if you want to lower your leverage or avoid being liquidated.&#x20;

<figure><img src="https://2469880511-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fmwt0Dje2oDasvK6hXXbX%2Fuploads%2FpZu9knqpaAjTxVQnKOao%2FAdd%20Collateral%20(3).png?alt=media&#x26;token=76183314-9532-4768-899d-08ad86405937" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Add Collateral button is in the Position Tab under the Collateral column.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Update SL / TP&#x20;

Both stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) prices can be updated for active positions. When updating, ensure that both prices are set to the desired values as they will be updated simultaneously.

<figure><img src="https://2469880511-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fmwt0Dje2oDasvK6hXXbX%2Fuploads%2F47zdTXz3Z8xM2TENnFn0%2FSLTP.png?alt=media&#x26;token=aeb070f8-2c96-443a-89cc-660cb35ce037" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Update SL/TP button is in the Position Tab under SL/TP.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Position Close / Partial Close

You can close your position and receive the position value in a stablecoin (collateral + PnL - fees).

You can also choose to partially close a position by specifying the portion of the position size you would like to close. When you select the "Keep Leverage" option, a amount of collateral will be returned to maintain the same leverage level for the remaining position.

# Liquidation

All open positions are subject to liquidation when the position‚Äôs equity value (collateral + PnL - fees) drops below 10% of the initial collateral size.

### Liquidation Threshold Factor

The liquidation threshold factor is currently set to 10% for all pairs. This means that if the net PnL (PnL - fees) of your position is below -90%, the position is subject to being liquidated.

### Liquidation Price

The liquidation price of a position may be changed over time as funding fee accumulate to the position's value.

$$LiqPrice = EntryPrice \cdot (1 - \frac{CollateralSize \cdot LiquidationThresholdFactor - ExitFee - FundingFees}{PositionSize})$$

where

* `ExitFee` is the amount of [maker or taker fee](fees) that is proportional to the position size.
* `FundingFees` is the amount of cumulative[ funding fee](fees) of the position.&#x20;


# Price Feed

Merkle Trade utilizes [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/), a decentralized oracle network with the lowest latency as the primary source for order execution pricing.

### Order Execution Flow

In order to prevent any front-running, orders are executed through a process involving two separate transactions:

1. Trader submits an order with a price with slippage applied, which then awaits the execution within the contract.
2. Keeper submits a transaction for execution with the real-time index price, then the order is executed with the mark price.

Keepers are initially run by the core team. However, we plan to decentralize the keepers by establishing the decentralized keeper network in the near future.




How To Fetch Price Updates
The following guide explains how to fetch price updates. Price updates can be submitted to the Pyth Price Feeds contract to update the on-chain price. Please see What is a Pull Oracle? to learn more.

Price updates are served from Hermes, which provides three different ways to fetch price updates:

REST API
Streaming
SDK
Fetching a price from Hermes requires a price feed ID. This ID serves as a unique identifier for each price feed (e.g., BTC/USD). The complete list of Pyth price feed IDs is available at https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/price-feeds

REST API
Hermes exposes several endpoints to fetch the price updates. Use the /v2/updates/price/latest endpoint to fetch the latest price update for one or more feeds. This endpoint allows you to fetch the latest price updates for multiple feeds in a single request. For example, the following command retrieves the latest price updates for BTC/USD and ETH/USD:

curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://hermes.pyth.network/v2/updates/price/latest?ids%5B%5D=0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43&ids%5B%5D=0xc96458d393fe9deb7a7d63a0ac41e2898a67a7750dbd166673279e06c868df0a'

The output will be similar to the following containing the requested price update:

{
  "binary": {

Hermes offers several other endpoints for retrieving price updates. For more information, see the Hermes API Reference.

Streaming
Hermes also provides a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint to stream price updates. The /v2/updates/price/stream endpoint continuously streams price updates for the requested feeds to the caller.

The connection will automatically close after 24 hours to prevent resource leaks. Clients should implement reconnection logic to maintain continuous price updates.

For example, to stream price updates for BTC/USD, run:

curl -N 'https://hermes.pyth.network/v2/updates/price/stream?ids[]=0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43'

SDK
Pyth provides a typescript SDK for Hermes to fetch price updates. The HermesClient class in this SDK connects to Hermes to fetch and stream price updates.

const connection = new HermesClient("https://hermes.pyth.network", {});
 
const priceIds = [
  // You can find the ids of prices at https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/price-feeds
  "0xe62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43", // BTC/USD price id
  "0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace", // ETH/USD price id
];
 
// Get price feeds
// You can also fetch price feeds for other assets by specifying the asset name and asset class.
const priceFeeds = await connection.getPriceFeeds("btc", "crypto");
console.log(priceFeeds);
 
// Latest price updates
const priceUpdates = await connection.getLatestPriceUpdates(priceIds);
console.log(priceUpdates);

HermesClient also allows subscribing to real-time price updates over a Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection:

// Streaming price updates
const eventSource = await connection.getStreamingPriceUpdates(priceIds);
 
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log("Received price update:", event.data);
};
 
eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error("Error receiving updates:", error);
  eventSource.close();
};
 
await sleep(5000);
 
// To stop listening to the updates, you can call eventSource.close();
console.log("Closing event source.");
eventSource.close();


Asset Classes
Pyth price feeds provide market data for the following asset classes:

Asset Class	Subclass	Definition
Crypto	Spot Prices	Real-time prices for cryptocurrencies and digital assets
Redemption Rates	Real-time swap rates derived from smart contracts for the redemption of liquid staking and liquid restaking tokens (LSTs and LRTs), liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens) and interest-bearing assets, including tokenised notes
Indices	Real-time prices that measure the performance of baskets of cryptocurrencies and digital assets
US Equities	Spot Prices	Real-time prices for US equities
FX	Spot Prices	Real-time prices for fiat currency pairs
Metals	Spot Prices	Real-time prices for precious metals
Rates	Future Prices	Real-time prices for fixed income products, including bond futures
Commodities	Futures Prices	Real-time prices for commodity futures
Energy	Spot Prices	Real-time prices for a non-expiring Contract for Difference (CFD) that tracks the price of the asset
Futures Prices	Real-time prices for energy futures contract
NOTE: When integrating with Energy Futures Price Feeds, it is not recommended to rely solely on the first month expiry price feed as there is often lower liquidity towards expiration. Best practice is to combine, 1-month, 2-month and 3-month feeds or use the weighted average which is represented by spot price(USOILSPOT or UKOILSPOT). Please refer to the Best Practices page for more information.

Price Feeds
Pyth Price Feeds provide real-time, first-party, market data for a wide range of assets.

Every price feed has a unique ID, representing the specific pair of assets being priced. These specific pairs are part of an asset class, which is a broader category of assets.

Anyone can fetch available price feeds and their IDs via Hermes API.

Asset Classes
Every price feed belongs to an asset class. These asset classes distinguish between different types of assets, such as crypto, US equities, and metals.

Refer to the Asset Classes page to learn more about the existing asset classes.

Price Feed IDs
Price Feed IDs are unique identifiers for each specific pair of assets being priced (e.g. BTC/USD). Every price update is tagged with the corresponding price feed ID.

Applications need to store the IDs of the feeds they wish to read. However, the IDs may be represented in different formats (e.g. hex or base58) depending on the blockchain. Price feeds also have different IDs in the Stable and Beta channels.

Solana Price Feed Accounts
On Solana, each feed additionally has a collection of price feed accounts containing the feed's data. The addresses of these accounts are programmatically derived from the feed id and a shard id, which is simply a 16-bit number. See How to Use Real-Time Data on Solana for more information on price feed accounts.
